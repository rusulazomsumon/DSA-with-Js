There’s not only one way to solve a problem, but not all of them are the best. Every solution is not capable of efficiently using our resources. Therefore, we need to find the best, most efficient solution to a problem before taking action.

In programming, we can’t leave the mechanism of finding the best solution, the best algorithm to guesswork. We need a clear standard to evaluate their efficiency. This is where the concepts of time and space complexity steps in. They help us determine the algorithm’s efficiency based on the required resources.

In this post, we are going to talk about the concepts of time and space complexity and how we can use them to select the most efficient algorithm for a given task. And of course, this is where notations like O(n), O(logn) that may have baffled you while learning algorithms come from.

Algorithms: Complexity

#

The time and space used by the algorithm are the two
main measures for the efficiency

The time is measured by the counting the number of
key operations

The space is measured by the maximum of memory
needed by the algorithm

If the complexity of an algorithm is f(n) given n is the
size of the input data,

Worst case: the maximum value of f(n) for any possible
input

Average case: the expected value of f(n)

Best case: the minimum possible value of f(n)

The space-time trade-off refers to a choice between
algorithmic solutions of a data processing problem
that allows one to decrease the running time of an
algorithmic solution by increasing the space to store
the data and vice versa.
